solidity-core-labs is a hands-on research and experimentation repository focused on mastering Solidity fundamentals, EVM behavior, and smart contract design at the lowest level.

This repo is not about building dApps. It is about understanding why Solidity behaves the way it does storage, memory, calldata, gas, execution flow, and failure modes through isolated, minimal, test-driven labs.

Each lab explores one core concept with intentionally small contracts, explicit assumptions, edge cases, and observations relevant to real-world protocol and security work.
